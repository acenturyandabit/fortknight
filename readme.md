## Pull Requests
While this repository is designed to be easyish to contribute to, it is not as easy as other pull-request-tutorials. You'll need to be able to write functional code in JS!

If you're looking for generic things to contribute to, you can try the below, and come back when you're more ready:
- [Open Pixel Art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art)
